              Welcome to my blog! I’m excited to share with you one of my
              favorite bands,
              <a href="https://www.oneokrock.com/"
                ><strong>One OK Rock</strong></a
              >. If you’re into rock music with a mix of Japanese and English
              lyrics, this band might be the perfect fit for your playlist.

            <h3>Why OOR?</h3>
            <p>
              One OK Rock has been a huge inspiration for me. Their unique
              sound, blending rock, punk, and post-hardcore, really speaks to
              me. Songs like
              <strong>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/4n5bpeh5NNg?si=rEVYEf_xLKpjc6Yq"
                  >"Renegades"</a
                ></strong
              >
              and
              <strong>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/eoQAnGx4Pss?si=iVKfvtCWpk42q030"
                  >"Wherever You Are"</a
                ></strong
              >
              have become anthems in my life, offering both energy and emotion
              that stick with me long after the music ends.

                  One OK Rock was formed back in 2005 in Tokyo, and like many
                  great bands, their journey started with a group of friends who
                  just wanted to make music together. It all began when Toru
                  Yamashita, the guitarist, had a dream of starting a rock band
                  and invited his buddy Ryota Kohama, who actually wasn’t even a
                  bassist back then—he was into hip-hop dancing! Pretty cool,
                  right?
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
                <p>
                  Later, Taka Moriuchi
                  <del>(my bf)</del> joined as the lead vocalist, bringing an
                  amazing vocal range and passion to the group. Eventually,
                  drummer Tomoya Kanki completed the lineup, and the magic of
                  One OK Rock started to take shape.

                <p>
                  So why the name One OK Rock? It’s a fun story! They used to
                  practice at one o’clock in the morning, and when said quickly
                  in Japanese, “one o’clock” sounds like “One OK Rock” because
                  of how the "L" and "R" sounds mix. They liked the sound of it
                  and decided to stick with the name. It’s catchy and really
                  represents the early days of the band when they were just
                  finding their sound late at night.
                </p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
                <p>
                  One OK Rock hit the big leagues with their song "The
                  Beginning" in 2012, which was featured in the live-action
                  Rurouni Kenshin movie. That song not only blew up in Japan but
                  also caught the attention of international audiences. Their
                  style—a blend of rock, punk, and post-hardcore—combined with
                  lyrics in both Japanese and English, makes their music
                  universal, and that’s a big reason why so many people around
                  the world love them today.

                intense, rock-driven melody.
              </li>
              <li>

                <strong>"Gravity"</strong> – This song holds a special place for
                me! It's not only beautifully composed but also conveys a deep
                emotional weight. The lyrics and the soaring melody (the guitar
                playing omg) just resonate on a personal level, making it one of
                my all-time favorites from One OK Rock.
