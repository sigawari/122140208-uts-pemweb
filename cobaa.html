        <h2>Why OOR?</h2>
        <p>
          One OK Rock has been a huge inspiration for me. Their unique sound,
          blending rock, punk, and post-hardcore, really speaks to me. Songs
          like
          <a href="https://youtu.be/4n5bpeh5NNg?si=rEVYEf_xLKpjc6Yq"
            >"Renegades"</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://youtu.be/eoQAnGx4Pss?si=iVKfvtCWpk42q030"
            >"Wherever You Are"</a
          >
          have become anthems in my life, offering both energy and emotion that
          stick with me long after the music ends.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p><em>The history about how i met them? Hehe jk</em></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          One OK Rock was formed back in 2005 in Tokyo, and like many great
          bands, their journey started with a group of friends who just wanted
          to make music together. It all began when Toru Yamashita, the
          guitarist, had a dream of starting a rock band and invited his buddy
          Ryota Kohama, who actually wasn’t even a bassist back then—he was into
          hip-hop dancing! Pretty cool, right? Later, Taka Moriuchi
          <del>(my bf)</del> joined as the lead vocalist, bringing an amazing
          vocal range and passion to the group. Eventually, drummer Tomoya Kanki
          completed the lineup, and the magic of One OK Rock started to take
          shape.
        </p>

        <p>
          So why the name One OK Rock? It’s a fun story! They used to practice
          at one o’clock in the morning, and when said quickly in Japanese, “one
          o’clock” sounds like “One OK Rock” because of how the "L" and "R"
          sounds mix. They liked the sound of it and decided to stick with the
          name. It’s catchy and really represents the early days of the band
          when they were just finding their sound late at night.
        </p>

        <p>
          One OK Rock hit the big leagues with their song "The Beginning" in
          2012, which was featured in the live-action Rurouni Kenshin movie.
          That song not only blew up in Japan but also caught the attention of
          international audiences. Their style—a blend of rock, punk, and
          post-hardcore—combined with lyrics in both Japanese and English, makes
          their music universal, and that’s a big reason why so many people
          around the world love them today.

            featured in the *Rurouni Kenshin* movie. It’s often cited as a fan
            favorite for its high energy and emotional depth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"Mighty Long Fall"</strong> – A powerful song about the fear
            of losing someone, which gained massive popularity with its intense,
            rock-driven melody.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"Wherever You Are"</strong> – This ballad has a more
            emotional, romantic side, making it a go-to song for fans who love
            heartfelt lyrics.
          </li>

            just resonate on a personal level, making it one of my all-time
            favorites from One OK Rock.
